# Project-1---Energy-Usage

**Project Overview**

This project was based on an Australian Energy Usage company called **'AusEnergy'**
AusEnergy had supplied me with some existing data regarding energy demand in Australia over a few years and hoped that I could interpet their data well.


**The main objective of this project was to:**
- See what energy demand looks like overtime.
- See what does extreme demand look like, and under what circumstance does this happen.
- Understand how factors such as the weather and holidays affect energy demand.

**What tools did I use to complete this project?**

The main tool that was used for conducting analysis on this project was **Microsoft Excel.**
